    <p>ew Delhi: People were screaming for help and crying, a Mumbai Port Trust (MBPT) pilot boat said, at the site where a ferry and a Indian Navy craft crashed off the city's coast.
        Thirteen people died and 99 were rescued as an Indian Navy undergoing engine trials lost control and collided with a passenger ferry that was carrying passengers from the Gateway of India to Elephanta Island.
        
        Among the first ones to reach the accident site, pilots of some boats said this was the most horrific event they had seen in their lives. Among them was Arif Bamane, who told PTI that rescuers prioritised women and children.
