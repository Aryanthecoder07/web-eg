    <p>SETTING THE stage for another confrontation with the government, the Opposition on Wednesday cut across party lines to demand Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s “removal” from the Cabinet, accusing him of “insulting” Dr B R Ambedkar in his remarks in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.

        Calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act “before midnight”, the Opposition parties raised the issue in both Houses of Parliament and also staged protests outside, displaying Ambedkar’s photographs and raising slogans like, “Amit Shah maafi maango; Babasaheb ka apmaan, nahin sahega Hindustan (Amit Shah, apologise; Babasaheb’s insult will not be tolerated).”
        
        In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Derek O’Brien submitted a privilege notice against Shah. And in Lok Sabha, Congress MP K Suresh gave a notice for an adjournment motion to discuss Shah’s remarks.</p>
